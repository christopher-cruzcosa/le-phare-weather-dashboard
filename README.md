# le-phare-weather-dashboard
A weather dashboard for all those voyageurs de phare.

## Installation

This web app is made up of an Index.html file and a script.js file, which controls the weather dashboard functionality.  There is also a css file for some styling.

The location is: https://christopher-cruzcosa.github.io/le-phare-weather-dashboard/


## Usage 

![Screenshot](./assets/images/screenshot1.png)

The user will initially see a weather dashboard populated by New York.  When they search for a city, it will replace New York and a button will be made in the search history section to note that the city was searched for previously.  The weather for each city will display the current attributes of the weather at that city including: temperature, wind speed, humidity, an icon for current conditions, and UV index.  There will also be a five day forecast that will show an icon for current weather, temperature, and humidity.
